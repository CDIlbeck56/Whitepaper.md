I am going to investigate the animal nutrition. I will be looking at the nutrient requirements for production animals like cows, pigs, and chickens. I will research their dieatary needs and what they are feed or need to be feed. I will research how different diets affect the  production levels for cows, pigs, and chickens. I will also look at how animal diets or what animals are feed affect human consumption.
