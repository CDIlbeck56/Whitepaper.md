# What I am investigating

In the process of doing research about genetically modified organisms (GMO's), I was looking for sources that talked about the health concerns, labeling, issues, and enviornmental concerns. In addition, I also looked for sources that provided some statistics. I paln to write to people that are concerned with GMO's and have little to no knowlege about them. I hope to persuade them that they are far more benefical than harmful. So, alot of my information used in this paper will be scienitic data.
