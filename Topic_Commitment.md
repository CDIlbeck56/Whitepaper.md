My topic is the health concerns related to GMO's. In my paper, I will aslo dicusses the importance using of GMO's. My audience will be people concerned with the consumtion of GMO's. I think in particular it the group of people that will read this paper our people of my generation. My call to action for the paper is to stop spreading all the myths about GMO's and start doing some research about them. I plan to talk about how people are concerned with carcinogens, issues with GMO labeling, how GMO's are feeding a growning poulation, how they have decreased the use of pesticides, and how they lower the price of food in the grocery store. My goal is to really prove that the GMO's are needed and there are a lot of false information about them.
